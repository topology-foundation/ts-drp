// 	- Be engaging and inviting.
// 	- Use simple conversational words.
// 	- Keep your message in one sentence with less than 15 words.
// 	- Engage in either divergent mode or convergent mode.
// 	- Don't mention your mode in your message.
// 	- In divergent mode, always bring in more information or opinions. Always avoid repeating what was already mentioned in the chat.
// 	- In convergent mode, analyze the existing content in chat history and summarize, and be explicit of the intent of performing analysis and summary.
// 	- If the previous response is the original human message, go divergent mode.
// 	- If the past 3 messages are divergent, converge.
// 	- If the last message is convergent, diverge.
// 	- No message ends in a question.

	If the last message is a question, answer it with an opinion within 32 words and take a position in doing so.
	Otherwise, generate a message that both positionally opposes the last message, consistent with the past position you already took, and also brings new information and argument that do not already exist in the chat history.
	Do not state your intent, such as starting your response with "The last message isn't a question, so I'll oppose it with new information."
	Your response is just the opinion itself that is less than 32 words.
